A quick and dirty hack to get circadian lighting with Philips Hue

Previous attempts to use off-the-shelf software proved to have issues with scene detection resulting in lights desyncing from the circadian schedule spontaneously. As I don't use scenes at home, I wrote a dirty hack to forcefully set the colour temperature and Luminosity values regardless of if there is a scene or not to avoid any issues with the lights de-syncing.

**Note: I made this OSS in case it will be helpful to someone. Feature requests and bug reports will be rejected/closed unless you submit a PR to add/fix it yourself.**
